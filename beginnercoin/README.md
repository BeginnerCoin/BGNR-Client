What is BeginnerCoin?
----------------

BeginnerCoin is a free, open-source project to help drastically lower the barrier to entry to enjoying the benefits of the cryptocurrency world.  The technology can be imposing. It is initially very difficult to comprehend, wrapped in a technical bubble of programming jargon. But Bitcoin and many other Cryptocurrencies are not just for the technically savvy among us.

We aim to lift the veil and let people know there is nothing to be intimidated by - especially when you us common sense security precautions. BGNR is the cryptocurrency of the BeginnerCoin blockchain, used to power the entire BeginnerCoin ecosystem. Our software is a modified fork (open-source variation) of the original Bitcoin protocol and software. You can mine BeginnerCoin while also mining bitcoin through a process called merge-mining.

Unlike Bitcoin, we aren't here to try to radically change the world's economic system. We're just here to help you understand how it all works. And why it matters.

We wish to provide a stepping stone to let you, your friends and your business partners realize the great potential represented by cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology.

Our goal is enable anyone with basic computer skills to receive, send and trade cryptocurrencies without risk to gain familiarity in using cryptocurrency and wallet software.  We are here to help you understand how to facilitate day-to-day transactions with cryptocurrency to remove the unknown and help you understand its full potential. You will discover that itâ€™s no different than using any other computer software. The difference is that units of cryptocurrency can be worth hundreds - even thousands - each in U.S. Dollar value.

But that's not the reason you should consider using cryptocurrency. You should be using it because cryptocurrency empowers you.
